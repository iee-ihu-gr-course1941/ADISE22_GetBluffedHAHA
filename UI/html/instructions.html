         <p id="how-to-play">One pack of 52 cards is used for four or fewer players; games with five or more players generally combine two 52-card packs. The cards are shuffled and dealt as evenly as possible among the players, with no cards left. Depending on the number of players, some may end up with one card more or less than the others. Players may look at their hands.
            The player who sits to the left of the dealer (clockwise) usually takes the first turn, and calls aces. The second player does the same, and calls twos. Play continues like this, increasing rank each time, with aces following kings. As players call the rank, they discard one or more cards face down, and declare the number of cards discarded. Players may lie by including cards which are not of the rank required for that turn.          
            If any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out by shouting "Cheat" (or "Bluff", "I doubt it", etc.). This stops the play, and the cards in question are revealed to all players. If the accused player was indeed lying, they have to take the whole pile of cards into their hand. If that player was right about the cards they played, the caller must take the pile into their hand. Once the next player has placed cards, however, it is too late to call out any previous players.            
            The game ends when one player runs out of cards, at which point that player wins.</p>
